Not quite as hard, but they're constantly available and for dirt cheap. People use social media and smartphone for the good feelings they get from likes\/retweets\/(you)s, etc.\nThis constant bombarding the brain with dopamine is leading to a global psychosis. We're currently seeing this live and hourly.\n\nOne of the defining symptoms of psychosis is NOT KNOWING or being able to discern truth from fantasy. The same symptoms are being seen in society right now. If you have wondered why everything seems batshit insane and psychotic, THIS IS WHY. What's worse, people who are psychotic rarely actually know it. Especially stupid people(IQ under 129 or so). Social media and smartphones are literally acting like methamphetamine in the \"global\" populace right now, and NOBODY seems to be aware of this, which makes sense as pointed out above.\n\nYou look closelly at all of these protests\/riots. Most people are either using their phones or WILL use their phones within 5 minutes, in the video.\nCLEAR addictive behaviors. It's literally like they are doing KEY BUMPS."

            "body": "Our ancestors have always known that free sexuality would lead to a bad outcome for everyone.\nIn our hubris, we have decided we know better and started an experiment with consequences that are beginning to show.\n\nHumans are a naturally polygynous species. Comparisons of paternally inherited Y-DNA vs. maternal mDNA show a divergence in genetic diversity such that for every one male, 17 females have reproduced.\n\nOf course, such brutal male selection has the consequence of high male competitiveness and violence.\nThis is the reason for why we have evolved a sexual dimorphism between the sexes.\nIn other species, the higher the dimorphism, the less monogamous they are.\n\nThe genius of enforcing monogamy in humans led to a 1:1 pairing of the sexes, unlocking a huge amount of male resources previously spent on infighting, a civilization-building feat.\nMonogamy has now become optional and even disincentivized, turning back the clock.\n\nSo we return to the times of 1 male for 17 females, but since we have laws against murder and rape, and because we have the state providing for single mothers, we have, in the west, nearly disabled natural selection. That leaves us with sexual selection as the distinctor.\n\nThis is why the most important male traits are now largely genetic: A large skeleton (height, frame), robust\/aesthetic craniofacial bones (jawline, orbital ridge, face), full hair, beard, etc. Women are basically selecting for the strongest caveman without any actual fighting.\n\nHence the males of lower genetic value are forced to become suicidal, homosexual, transsexual, homicidal, a blue-pilled beta or a cuckold, all of which manifest in males much more often than females.\n\nMuch of what we see today is an inevitability of the incentives set up the last decades.\nIf we continue on this path, it is clear that, without rewarding the subservient male with procreation, civilization cannot be upheld and we will revert to a more primitive state of mankind.\n\nWhile feminism pretends to fight against male toxicity, it is actually encouraging it.\nAfter all, if given free choice, women will choose the meanest, baddest and most dominant.\nNo wonder that 513 Shades is the book that has sold the most copies in human history.\n\nIn contrast, monogamy pacifies male \"toxicity\" and leads, applied consequently over long periods of time, to diminished sexual dimorphism.\nMonogamy was actually a progressive idea. Today's \"progressives\" are really regressive. Big irony of our times."
